# CMPT 106 Group Project - Tom's Cave Escape (A 3D Cave Escape Action-Genre Game)

A three-dimensional game in a group of 7 people using the Unity and Blender programs to generate a virtual reality shooting experience for my CMPT 106 (Applied Science, Technology, and Society) class.

Additional responsibilities included:

* Sculpting and designing models using the Blender modelling program to feature various character, enemy, weapon and cave assets for the game
* Implementing character animations using Blender's animation tools to display real-life movements such as walking, running, jumping, and dying
* Collaborating with members by importing files and documents through the Google Drive cloud platform to organize responsibilities for modelling, sculpting, and visual/sound effects
